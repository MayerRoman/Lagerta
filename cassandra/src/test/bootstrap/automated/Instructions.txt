1. Install Python 3.5.x. Optionally add python interpreter to your system path.
   On Windows it is recommended to check the box "Add Python 3.5 to PATH" while using GUI installer.
2. Install requirements with command: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare config.ini file by image of default one
4. Start load-test.py. The script accepts the following options:
        --config=<path> - Sets the path to the configuration ini file
                          of the script. Default to the file named config.ini
                          located in the script working directory.
        --test-name-prefix=<str> - String that will be used to prefix directories
                                   created for running test parts on remote hosts
                                   and storing there test logs and statistics report.
                                   Default to "scal" - shortening to scalability.
        --redeploy - Flag, if present the script will remove all existing activestore
                     deployments on the test hosts and reupload the distributive from
                     the local node to them.
   Example:
       python load_test.py --config=C:\conf.ini --test-name-prefix=test --redeploy

Note: If python interpreter is not added to the system path you will need to type the full path
      to the python executable and run pip with the command: <path-to-python-executable> -m pip ...

Some of the script options that are usually unchanged are defined in "common.py" file,
where they can be changed to anything that is a valid python code.

The script places activestore distributive (zip and unarchived) in a home directory
of the user used to login to remote hosts. For each run with a different number
of servers it creates a separate working directory under the user home named
with the following pattern: <test-name-prefix>-load-test-<number-of-servers>s
This directory is used to store test logs.

When script starts statistics driver remotely it changes remote statistics report directory
from the one set in load-tests.properties file to the "report" located in the aforementioned
test directory.

At the end of each test run statistics report is downloaded to the directory located under
the script working directory and as the test working directory on the remote host, e.g.
"scal-load-test-4s".

If you run the script with such name prefix parameter that the test directory name will
class with the name of already existing one on some of remote nodes (e.g. from the previous
script runs) the existing directory content will be moved to directory named with the same
name plus "_<timestamp>" under the same parent directory.

It might be useful to install script requirements in the separate virtualenv.
