Contributing 
============

There are lots of ways to contribute.  People with different expertise can help with various subprojects:
    
* __core__ :    Core functionality of the replicator, where most of the value of the project sits
* __cassandra__ : Reference implmentation of the long-term storage layer
* __documentation__ : We are always in need of a better documentation!
* __giving feedback__ : Tell us how you use Lathgertha, what was great and what was not so great.
                        Also, what are you expecting from it and what would you like to see in the future?
 
Also, reporting new issues and getting started by posting on the mailing list is helpful.

RTC model
=========

Lathgertha is developed under Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model. The following rules
will be used for the RTC process:
  * a committer or a contributor should proactively seek a code review and
    feedback from other contributors. To speed up the review process the common
    sense quality criteria are expected to be met (e.g. reasonable testing has
    been done locally; all compilations pass; RAT check is passed; the patch
    follows coding guidelines)
  * a committer should keep an eye on the official CI builds at
    <TBD> to make sure that committed changes haven't break anything. In
    which case the committer should take a timely effort to resolve the
    issues and unblock the others in the community
  * any non-document patch needs to address all the comment and reach consensus
    before it gets committed without a +1 from other committers
